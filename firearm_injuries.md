## Project Introduction
Firearm violence remains one of the most pressing public health issues in the United States. Firearm injuries are highly lethal and contribute substantially to premature death and illness in the United States (Spitzer et al.,  2020). There is no comprehensive data source for all firearm injuries and deaths in the United States. Many national databases focus solely on deaths, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiological Research (WONDER) and National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). Databases by the CDC collect non-fatal injury data from less than 100 of the 5,000 emergency rooms in the United States; multiple analyses have the data unreliable (Campbell et al., 2018; Kaufman et al., 2021). Data from electronic medical records (EMR) can bridge this gap in knowledge. Understanding the nature and magnitude of gun violence is one step in creating a public health approach to prevent this loss of life.

## Project Description
This study examines the epidemiology of fatal and nonfatal firearm-related hospitalizations across 164 US hospitals. Over 82,000 Americans were non-fatally injured or died in acts involving a firearm in 2020 (Agresti et al., 2021). These acts included assault, self-directed violence, legal intervention, accidental discharge, and those where intent could not be determined. Although the rate of gun injuries has declined in recent years, the United Statesâ€™ rates remain significantly higher than most countries in the world (Alpers & Wilson, 2013). Trends in assault, self-harm, and unintentional injuries over the five years are described alongside demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and race/ethnicity. Firearm injury data were obtained using the HCA Healthcare Enterprise Data Warehouse.

For the purposes of this study, a firearm injury is defined as a wound or penetrating injury from a weapon that uses a powder charge to fire a projectile. Injuries were tabulated by intent, age group, and race/ethnicity. Patients who expired in the hospital or were discharged to hospice were counted as fatalities. These are included as a subset of total injuries. Threshold of significance was set at .05. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 24 (IBM Corporation).

 The sample comprises 29,406 total firearm injury encounters with an annual 5,881 encounters. Firearm injuries increased by 17% on average each year. The majority of injuries were from accidental firearm discharge (77%), followed by assault (15%), and intentional self-harm (6%). Men accounted for over 85% of all firearm injuries. Ethnic minorities had higher rates of accidental and assault injuries. Risk for firearm self-harm was concentrated among White males and increased with age. Further research on the nature of firearm injuries in the United States is needed. Understanding the distribution and magnitude of firearm injuries is an initial step in developing evidence-based interventions to lessen the impact of firearms.
