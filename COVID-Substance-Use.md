This study will aim to observe the effect of the pandemic and subsequent social distancing recommendations on individuals with substance use disorders (SUD) by change in admission rates from the year before the pandemic to this year. While these results will not change social distancing recommendations, it may affect considerations in the future to make arrangements for these individuals.




## Project Introduction
We predict that the COVID-19 pandemic will harm worldwide mental health. A complete understanding of this phenomenon is likely to take years to decades after the end of the pandemic. One unfortunate consequence of social distancing recommendations has been the closure of social resources on which substance users rely. This study will aim to observe the effect of the pandemic and subsequent social distancing recommendations on individuals with substance use disorders (SUD) by analyzing the change in admission rates between 2019 and 2020.

## Project Description
Limited data exist regarding the prevalence of substance use disorders or utilization of mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study aims to specifically identify trends in the utilization of behavioral health units (BHU) in those with substance use disorders (SUD).  

Patient electronic health records (EHR) were analyzed from fourteen hospitals principally located in the US mid-Atlantic region. To compare SUD admissions before and after COVID-19 quarantine periods, patient data from BHUs were collected from two time periods: February 1st, 2019 to May 31st, 2019, and February 1st, 2020 to May 31st, 2020. 

The number of SUD admissions to BHUs did not change from 2019 to 2020 but there was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of SUD patients admitted to BHUs (χ2 = 83.47, p < .001, V = 0.06). We also detected a significant difference in the proportion of SUD severity between 2019 and 2020 with a small but significant overall decrease in the proportion of moderate/severe cases (χ2 = 5.70, p < .001, V = 0.05) in SUD patients. 

Our data suggest that even during the times of a global pandemic when there is a decline in health care utilization in other settings, the need for inpatient substance use treatment should not be expected to decrease and increased use of telemedicine may be beneficial for this vulnerable population.
