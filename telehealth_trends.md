## Project Introduction
The U.S. health economy is the largest sector of the largest global economy. Hospitals constitute the largest segment of the U.S. health economy, serving both as the provider of last resort care and a vital part of the local economy in every community, as the COVID-19 pandemic painfully reminded us. The purpose of this project is to evaluate shifts in telehealth supply and demand. The information from this project is intended to help healthcare executives begin to develop strategies to guide their organizations in a health economy recovering from the global COVID-19 pandemic.

## Project Description
The first year of the pandemic brought record-breaking shifts to the standard hospital business model. HCA Healthcare hospitals experienced a 42% decrease in encounters in April 2020 compared to the previous year and a 20% decrease in annual emergency department encounters. Simultaneously, telehealth utilization increased over 17% in the past year. As a result of the unprecedented increase in demand, many health systems, payers, employers, and Wall Street financiers have begun to pursue aggressive telehealth expansion strategies. This project explores trends in telehealth utilization, explains the effects of an oversaturated tele-medicine market, and provides recommendations to healthcare executives.
