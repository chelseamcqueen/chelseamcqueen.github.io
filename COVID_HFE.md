## Project Description
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease that increases the risk for mortality across a range of otherwise benign diseases. Due to COVID-19â€™s inflammatory response and increased risk for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, and multi-organ failure; this team hypothesizes a relationship between heart exacerbations and the severity of heart failure. The primary objective of this study is to determine the risk of HF exacerbation depending on NYHA classification among COVID-positive patients with known HF.
