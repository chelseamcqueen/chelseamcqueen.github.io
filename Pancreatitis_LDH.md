## Project Description
Acute pancreatitis is one of the most common gastrointestinal presentations to the Emergency department in the United States. We aim to perform a retrospective study on patients presenting with acute pancreatitis and to evaluate whether certain presentations are associated with a longer hospital stay, longer ICU stays, and higher mortality rate. We will compare patients over 50 with HCT >40, LDH >600, and/or comorbidities of interest.
